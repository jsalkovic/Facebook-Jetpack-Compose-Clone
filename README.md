* [`Coroutines`](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) for async programming.
* [`Hilt`](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for Depenency Injection.
* [`Retrofit`](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for network requests.
* [`Glide`](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) for image loading and cacheing.

## Customization
* All data was mocked and it's located [here](https://github.com/jsalkovic/Facebook-Compose-App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/hr/josip/facebook/data/common/Mock.kt).
* To customize stories, just modify [`getStories()`](https://github.com/jsalkovic/Facebook-Compose-App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/hr/josip/facebook/data/common/Mock.kt) method.
* To customize posts, just modify [`getPosts()`](https://github.com/jsalkovic/Facebook-Compose-App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/hr/josip/facebook/data/common/Mock.kt) method.
* To change current active user, which is needed for status update and comments, go inside [`UserManager`](https://github.com/jsalkovic/Facebook-Compose-App/blob/master/app/src/main/java/hr/josip/facebook/shared/manager/user/UserManagerImpl.kt) and provide your own data.
